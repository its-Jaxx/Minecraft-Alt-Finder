## Minecraft Alt Finder + Player Details
Very simple Python code that allows the user to see some information about a user and their bedwars shop (also shows if they've got alt accounts).

- [MC Alt Finder](https://github.com/its-Jaxx/Minecraft-Alt-Finder/blob/main/MC_Alt_Finder.py) simply prints all the information in the console.
- [MC Alt Finder TK](https://github.com/its-Jaxx/Minecraft-Alt-Finder/blob/main/MC_Alt_Finder_TK.py) opens a new window where it allows you to check several users without having difficulty looking around.
- An '.exe' file also exists in [releases](https://github.com/its-Jaxx/Minecraft-Alt-Finder/releases/tag/v1.1.0), however, I wouldn't depend on it since due to temporary API key.
